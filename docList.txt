A list of the things we need to add documentation for
(How to use, call, and/or modify. Probably good to note known issues, constraits, or nonstandard behavior)

1. shaderLoader (LoadShaders)
2. modelImport (importObj)
3. modelImport (configureObject)
4. lighting
5. camera
6. editing controls


Standards we should agree on

1. Naming Scheme (How to name variables, functions, and files)
2. Directories (Naming, where to keep source and documentation)
3. License (Probably MIT)
4. A name would probably be good
5. Whether we should write functions to be posix
6. If we should make functions like loadshaders callable from an external
    game function and require passing an gameInstance object for it to modify.
